# Example data set: Combined TMS Motor Study — Mixed Online/Offline Stimulation

This data set provides an example of formatting using a proposed nibs-bidsv5+ standard.

## Experiment details
This example demonstrates a realistic multi-session experiment combining both offline and online transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols targeting the motor cortex and parietal regions.
* Day 1 cTBS over inferior parietal cortex
* Day 2 cTBS over M1
* Day 3 Sham cTBS

•	Within each day
Block A SICI, ICF, single-pulse (SP) baseline with EMG MEPs
Block B Action-observation task with single-pulse TMS during video observation, EMG MEPs recorded
Block C SICI, ICF, SP post

•	Aim
Correlate SICI, ICF, SP changes with AO-MEP modulation. Run E-field checks based on coil geometry. Use neuronavigation
