# Example data set: prefrontal TMS-EEG

This data set provides an example of formatting using a proposed nibs-bidsv5 standard.

## Experiment details
The experiment involves collecting TMS-EEG data from an individual.
2 protocols are performed:
* RMT
* TMS-EEG over left prefrontal cortex (100 trials).
TMS is given over left prefrontal cortex, and EEG is recorded from 64 channels. Neuronavigation is used to record TMS coil position for each trial.

## Notes
The EEG data files are empty and do not correspond to BIDS data types.
They are included for demonstration purposes only.
