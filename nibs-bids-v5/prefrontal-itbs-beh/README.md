# Example data set: working memory before and after prefrontal iTBS.

This data set provides an example of formatting using a proposed nibs-bidsv5 standard.

## Experiment details
The experiment involves collecting working memory data before and after prefrontal iTBS from an individual.
4 protocols are performed:
* RMT
* Pre working memory performance
* iTBS over left prefrontal cortex (standard protocol).
* Post working memory performance

TMS is given over left prefrontal cortex. Neuronavigation is used to record TMS coil position.

## Notes
The data files are empty and do not correspond to BIDS data types.
They are included for demonstration purposes only.
