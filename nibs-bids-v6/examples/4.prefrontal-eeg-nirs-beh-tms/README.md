# Example data set: prefrontal TMS-EEG

This data set provides an example of formatting using a proposed nibs-bids.v6 standard.

## Experiment details
In this neuro-marketing study, participants evaluate product preferences (Brand A vs Brand B) while undergoing brain stimulation.
During the decision-making task, the following data are collected simultaneously:
- EEG (to monitor cognitive responses),
- fNIRS (to track prefrontal cortex activation),
- Behavioral data — including response times and button presses,
- TMS is applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during evaluation phases to modulate decision-related activity.

* Protocol: Single-pulse TMS
* Target: dlPFC 
* Intensity: 110% of RMT
* Total Pulses: 60 (10 pulses per block, 6 blocks total)
* Neuronavigation: Yes, coil position recorded for each pulse
