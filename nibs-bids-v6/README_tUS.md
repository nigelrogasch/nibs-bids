## 1. Detailed overview of data structure

### 1.1 `*_coordsystem.json` — Coordinate Metadata

A _coordsystem.json file is used to specify the fiducials, the location of anatomical landmarks, and the coordinate system and units in which the position of landmarks or tUS stimulation targets is expressed. 
Anatomical landmarks are locations on a research subject such as the nasion (for a detailed definition see the coordinate system appendix).
The _coordsystem.json file is REQUIRED for navigated tUS stimulation datasets. If a corresponding anatomical MRI is available, the locations of anatomical landmarks in that scan should also be stored in the _T1w.json file which accompanies the tUS data.

#### TUS-specific transducer coordinate metadata fields (*_coordsystem.json)

These optional fields are recommended for transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) datasets when the spatial position and/or orientation of the ultrasound transducer is known or fixed (e.g., in neuronavigated or modeled setups). 
They complement the standard NIBSCoordinateSystem fields, which typically describe the focus location.
Optional QC metric (in mm) representing the root-mean-square deviation of the ultrasound transducer's actual position and/or orientation from its intended location.
This may be computed from optical tracking, neuronavigation logs, or mechanical fixation assessment.

```

| ----------------------------------------------| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 				| ----------------------------------- |
| `TransducerCoordinateSystem					| string  | Name of the coordinate system used to define the transducer's position (e.g., IndividualMRI, CT, DeviceSpace, etc.).
| `TransducerCoordinateUnits					| string  | Units of measurement for transducer coordinates (typically mm).
| `TransducerCoordinateSystemDescription		| string  | Textual description of how the transducer coordinate system was defined and aligned with anatomy.
| `TransducerCoordinates						| object  | Dictionary with spatial coordinates (e.g., X, Y, Z ) and optionally 4×4 affine transformation matrix for transducer orientation.

```
*These fields enable reproducible modeling, visualization, and interpretation of TUS targeting and acoustic beam propagation when precise transducer positioning is known.

#### Optional Headshape Files (*_headshape.<extension>)

This file is RECOMMENDED.

3D digitized head points  that describe the head shape and/or EEG electrode locations can be digitized and stored in separate files. 
These files are typically used to improve the accuracy of co-registration between the stimulation target, anatomical data, etc. 

** For example:**

```
sub-<label>/
   └─ ses-<label>/
		└── nibs/
			└── sub-<label>[_ses-<label>]_task-<label>[_stimsys-<label>]_acq-HEAD_headshape.pos 

```
These files supplement the DigitizedHeadPoints, DigitizedHeadPointsUnits, and DigitizedHeadPointsDescription fields in the corresponding _coordsystem.json file. Their inclusion is especially useful when sharing datasets intended for advanced spatial analysis or electric field modeling.

### 1.2 `*_markers.tsv` — Stimulation Site Coordinates (optional sidecar `_markers.json` )

| `normal_z`			| number | Z-coordinate component of the unit vector normal to the scalp surface at the entry point, defining the intended beam orientation.

### 1.3 `*_nibs.json` — Sidecar JSON 

The _nibs.json file is a required sidecar accompanying the _nibs.tsv file. 
It serves to describe the columns in the tabular file, define units and levels for categorical variables, and—crucially—provide structured metadata about the stimulation device, task, and context of the experiment.

Like other BIDS modalities, this JSON file includes:

**Task information:**

- TaskName, TaskDescription, Instructions

**Institutional context:**

- InstitutionName, InstitutionAddress, InstitutionalDepartmentName

**Device metadata:**

- Manufacturer, ManufacturersModelName, SoftwareVersion, DeviceSerialNumber, StimulationSystemName, NavigationSystemName

Additionally, the _nibs.json file introduces a dedicated hardware block called "TransducerSet".
TransducerSet provides a structured, machine-readable description of one or more transcranial ultrasound transducers used in the dataset.
Each transducer is defined as an object with a unique TransducerID, which is referenced from the *_nibs.tsv file.
This structure mirrors the approach used in 'CoilSet' (TMS-section) and includes key physical and acoustic properties of each transducer, such as center frequency, focus depth, aperture diameter, and intensity-related parameters.

* Each entry in 'TransducerSet' is an object with the following fields:
```
Field									Type	Description
TransducerID							string	Unique identifier for the transducer, referenced from *_nibs.tsv.
TransducerType							string	Physical configuration: single-element, phased-array, planar, or custom.
FocusType								string	Acoustic focus shape: point, line, volume, or swept.
CarrierFrequency						number	Nominal center frequency of the ultrasound wave (Hz).
FocalDepth								number	Distance from the transducer surface to the acoustic focus (mm).
ApertureDiameter						number	Diameter of the ultrasound-emitting surface (mm).
PeakNegativePressure					number	Peak negative pressure in the focus (MPa).
MechanicalIndex							number	Safety-relevant mechanical index (dimensionless).
```

** Example:**
```
"TransducerSet": [
  {
    "TransducerID": "tr_1",
    "TransducerType": "single-element",
    "FocusType": "point",
    "CarrierFrequency": {
      "Value": 500000,
      "Units": "Hz",
      "Description": "Nominal center frequency of the ultrasound wave"
    },

      "Description": "Distance from the transducer surface to the acoustic focus"
    },
    "ApertureDiameter": {
      "Value": 15,
      "Units": "mm",
      "Description": "Diameter of the active transducer aperture"
    },
    "PeakNegativePressure": {
      "Value": 0.6,
      "Units": "MPa",
      "Description": "Peak negative pressure at the acoustic focus"
    },
    "MechanicalIndex": {
      "Value": 0.8,
      "Units": "dimensionless",
      "Description": "MI = Pneg / sqrt(frequency), safety-relevant indicator"
    }
  }
]
```

### 1.4 `*_nibs.tsv` — Stimulation Parameters4

This section describes all possible fields that may appear in *_nibs.tsv files. 
The fields are grouped into logical sections based on their function and purpose. 
All fields are optional unless stated otherwise, but some are strongly recommended.
The order of parameters in _nibs.tsv follows a hierarchical structure based on their variability during an experiment and their role in defining the stimulation process. 
Parameters are grouped into three logical blocks.
